# DriveCatalogue (starter)

This is a minimal starter to get your **Windows .exe** building via GitHub Actions.

## How to use

1. Create a new repo on GitHub named e.g. `DriveCatalogue` (tick *Add a README*).
2. Upload the contents of this folder to the repo (you can drag-and-drop all files and folders on the GitHub website).
3. Go to the **Actions** tab → run **Build Windows EXE**.
4. Download the artifact **DriveCatalogue-Windows** → inside you'll find `DriveCatalogue.exe`.

## Local build (optional)
- On Windows PowerShell:
```
build\build.ps1
```
